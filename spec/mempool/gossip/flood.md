# Flood protocol

## Description

Flood is a simple *push* gossip protocol: every time it receives a transaction, it forwards or
pushes it to all of its peers, except to the peer(s3) from which it received the transaction, if any.

## Types and notation

Types:
- `Tx` is the content of a transaction (typically an array of bytes).
- `TxID` is a transaction identifier, computed as the hash of the transaction (a short array of
  bytes).
- `NodeID` is a string used internally by the node to identify its peers.

In the following,
- `tx.ID = Hash(tx)` is the hash of transaction `tx`, of `TxID` type, and
- `peer.ID` is the identifier of `peer`, of `NodeID` type.

## Network

The network is comprised by a set of nodes. Each node has a set of peers. This defines the topology
of the network.

We assume that a node has reliable P2P channels to each peer.
- `peer.send(msg)` sends `msg` to `peer`.

## Messages

The Flood gossip protocol only communicates `Tx(tx)` messages, where `tx` is a full transaction of
arbitrary size.

Messages are transamitted via the `Mempool` channel on the P2P layer.

## State

The values of the following data structures partially define the state of the protocol.
- `pool: List[Tx]`: a concurrent list of pending transactions ("the mempool").
- `cache: Set[TxID]`: a set of transaction IDs (hashes).
- `senders: map TxID â†’ Set[NodeID]`: for each transaction in `pool`, a set of node IDs from which
  the node received the transaction. To keep track of all peers that send each transaction.
- There is one iterator `iter` per peer to traverse `pool`. It has only one method `next()` to
  retrieve the next entry in the list. If it reaches the end of the list, it blocks until a new
  entry is added. All iterators read concurrently from `pool`.

## Initial state

All data structures are initially empty when the mempool starts.
- `pool = List()`
- `cache = Set()`
- `senders = Map()`

## State transitions

### Handling incoming messages

Upon receiving a `Tx(tx)` message from `sender`, do `handleTxMessage(tx, sender)` where:
```
def handleTxMessage(tx, sender):
  if not(cache.contains(tx.ID)):
R1: 
    cache.add(tx.ID)
    if valid(tx):
      pool.append(tx)
      if sender != nil:
        senders[tx.ID].add(sender.ID)
  else:
R2: 
    if sender != nil and pool.contains(tx):
      senders[tx.ID].add(sender.ID)
```
- Transactions are created by users who send them to one of the nodes in the network. Nodes receive
transactions either from users or from peers. Transaction messages sent from users have no sender
(`sender` is `nil`). 
- Nodes receive transactions either for the first time (tag `R1`) or transactions were received
  before, thus they are cached (tag `R2`).
- Transactions are validated externally by the `valid(tx)` function.
- A transaction that is in `pool`, must also be in `cache` (assuming an infinite cache), but not
  necessarily the inverse. The reason a transaction is in `cache` but not in `pool` is either
  because: 
  - the transaction was initially invalid and never got into `pool`, 
  - the transaction became invalid after it got in `pool` and thus got evicted while revalidating
    it, or
  - the transaction was committed to a block and got removed from `pool`.
- Senders are only needed for disseminating (valid) transactions in the mempool. That is why we
  register senders only for transactions that are in actually in the mempool.
- All actions in the scope of a tag should be executed atomically.

### Dissemination

A node runs one `disseminateTo(peer)` process per connected `peer`:
```
def disseminateTo(peer):
  iter := pool.newIterator()
  while true:
    tx := iter.next()
D1:
    if not(senders[tx.ID].contains(peer.ID)):
      peer.send(Tx(tx))
```

The process iterates over `pool` reading the next (valid) transaction to send to `peer`. It sends
the transaction only if the node did not receive it from `peer` (tag `D1`).

## Properties

Pros:
+ Optimal latency (given the constrains of the network topology)
+ Tolerate malicious behaviour (BFT)

Cons:
- Bandwidth: exponential redundancy
